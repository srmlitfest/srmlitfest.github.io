                    <b>Happily ever after (or not)</b>
    <br>
                    After surviving a battle with depression and shifting colleges, life would pretty much be a cake-walk, or so l thought. My real struggles with identity and emotions began at a time when I thought the worst was over and everything would be good henceforth. The amount of self-exploration I did really got me in touch with myself and that, I realized, was the higher mountain go scale, not the illness.

                    <br><b>Young Politician</b><br>
                    <br>A leader and pleader, this book comes as a breath of fresh air in a country where the youth is only going further away from the concept of politics and governance. Listen to his tales of operating as a leader of the youth wing of a political party, the ups and downs that checked his patience and his sincere thoughts towards servant leadership while he answers your many questions on, WHY politics?

                    <br><br><b>The Price of Smiling</b><br>
                    <br>The topic of my book is mental health. I have dealt with depression and am living with generalized anxiety. I would like to share my experience with it. I was living I’m America at the time and although America is more accepting and kinder towards people suffering from mental illness, my story would illustrate how I was stuck without treatment because of the mentality that my parents who reflect the greater mentality of Indian community were raised in. My dad refused to <br>acknowledge the existence of a problem. My mom said it was all in my head. “Try a little harder.” “Don’t think so much.”

                    <br>My response to their solutions? Smiling. I managed to get out of my depressive episode after almost a year thanks to the support of outside sources. But if I hadn’t had that help, then I would’ve kept on smiling and pretending that nothing was wrong simply because of the prejudice that they were showing towards my cry for Help.

                    <br><br><b>Don’t “Dis” My Abilities</b><br>

                    <br>Subject of “inspiration porn,” seen as the “aspect of pity”…ever thought how we can be more disabled by the society than by our bodies?

                    <br>I was born with phocomelia: a rare, congenital arms deformity. But I seek the same things that anyone else in the world wants: to make this society a better, less prejudiced place to live. And while doing so, I reject able-ism: the systematic discrimination against the disabled that defines people by their disabilities and views them as inferior to the non-disabled.

                    <br>Erotica: Noun.
                    <br>Erotic art or literature
                    <br>Erotica means works of art that show or describe sexual activity, and which are intended to arouse sexual feelings of love.
                    <br><br>
                  <br>  Am glad if my erotica can do that. It is meant to titillate.
                    <br>What it isn’t meant to do is for a reader to consider the writer horny, easy and available.
                    <br>And when a woman is penning about desires and pleasures, in a society that largely stigmatises sex, she is seldom spared of this generalisation. I am not spared either. But does that stop me from writing what I like to write? No.
